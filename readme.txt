If you really think about it, then maybe? 

Some scenarios leaves you with choices that are really hard to determine, or even with no choices to begin with.

Doubting is only good when it leads you to a resolve.

If I asked the question of what matters, can you come up with an answer?

Keep doubting and come up with `something` or `nothing`.
